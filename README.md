# Hotel-survey

I have developed a comprehensive hotel survey dashboard using Power BI, which provides valuable insights into guest experiences and feedback. The dashboard is designed to be user-friendly and informative, featuring key performance indicators (KPIs) and various visualizations to track and analyze survey responses effectively.

Key Features:
KPIs:

Respondents: Total number of survey respondents.
Promoters: Guests who rated their experience highly.
Passives: Guests who had an average experience.
Detractors: Guests who rated their experience poorly.
Average Experience (Avg. Exp.): The overall average rating of guest experiences.
Average Net Promoter Score (Avg. NPS Score): The average NPS score calculated from the survey responses.
Slicers:

Year: Filter responses by the year the survey was taken.
Purpose: Filter responses by the purpose of the guests' stay (e.g., business, leisure).
Source: Filter responses by the source of the survey (e.g., online, in-person).
Visualizations:

Doughnut Charts:

Respondents by Gender: Distribution of survey respondents by gender.
Promoters by Gender: Distribution of promoters by gender.
Detractors by Gender: Distribution of detractors by gender.
Clustered Column Chart:

Gender by NPS and Year: Comparison of NPS scores by gender across different years.
Stacked Column Charts:

Respondents by Age Range: Distribution of respondents across different age ranges.
Respondents by Overall Experience: Overall experience ratings across different respondent categories.
Stacked Bar Charts:

Respondents by Purpose: Distribution of respondents based on the purpose of their stay.
Respondents by Source: Distribution of respondents based on the source of the survey.
Additional Features:
Interactivity: The slicers allow users to filter the data dynamically, providing a customized view based on specific criteria.
Comparative Analysis: The combination of different chart types helps in comparing and contrasting various aspects of the survey data, such as experience ratings across genders and age groups.
Trend Analysis: The clustered column chart facilitates the identification of trends over the years, particularly in NPS scores segmented by gender.
Call to Action:
Please share your thoughts about the dashboard and advise me on how to improve it. Your feedback is valuable for enhancing the effectiveness and usability of this tool.
